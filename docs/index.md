**Redefine how you interact with your code**

## Introduction
Vision is a modern, lightweight command bar built for all Roblox experiences—from massive games without thousands of players and dozens of developers, to small personal projects shared among friends. It’s designed to feel native, intuitive, and powerful right out of the box.

With Vision, you can easily build commands and apps that trigger functions on the server and client, open custom menus, reward players with coins, run admin or developer utilities, and so much more.

Vision was built to be extensible, adaptable, and modular; add custom behaviors and integrations, use it in a live game, testing experience, or studio, and keep your code organized, scalable, and maintainable.
