# Guide

Before you dive in, this guide assumes you already have some foundational knowledge.

!!! warning "Vision Is Still In Active Development"
    We're committed to keeping Vision stable, secure, and production-ready. That said, the design and API are still evolving.

    You may encounter **breaking changes** as we continue improving the library. These changes could require you to adapt your codebase. While we try to avoid major overhauls, they may occasionally happen — and if they do, we’ll communicate them clearly in advance.

    Expect updates that add, change, or remove features. Our goal is to provide a powerful and intuitive API, even if it means making tough decisions along the way.

## What You Should Know

1. Familiar with **Roblox Studio** or **Visual Studio Code**, along with common extensions such as [Wally](https://www.wally.run).
2. Knowledge in **[Luau](https://luau.org/getting-started)df** — we recommend at least understanding the basics of object-oriented programming.
3. If you plan to add custom UI features, we recommend learning [Fusion 0.3](https://elttob.uk/Fusion/0.3/). We’ll cover some basics, but prior knowledge will help.
